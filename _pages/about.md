I found out about jekyll site generator when scrolling through someone else's portfolio 
so I thought it is good to leave some info here on how to build similar site quite easily.

This website is built using Jekyll which is a library in Ruby to render 
markdown files into html static websites.
You can find out more about Jekyll here:
[github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/)
 and here: [jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Site is set to use jekyll gitbook theme. 
This allows fo friendly sidebar and useful to store large site of a content. 
Find out more about jekyll gitbook at [github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook](https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook)

Alternatively you can use default theme
[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). 
You can change theme in _conf.yaml file
